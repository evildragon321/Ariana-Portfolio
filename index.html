            <p>Ariana Grande is an American singer 
                and actress who has been making waves
                 world over for her singing prowess. 
                 Since a very young age she participated in plays 
                 and sang at public events, and gradually decided that 
                 she wants to do this all her life. Her first tryst with 
                 the world of entertainment was through the ‘Broadway’ musicals ‘Beauty and the Beast’ and ‘The Wizard of Oz’. 
                 She was also a part of the ensemble of various television shows, but later Ariana Grande decided to devote her 
                 attention mostly towards music. Her debut album ‘Yours Truly’ shattered several records and ruled the ‘Billboard Top
                  100’ chart for several weeks. Several hundred thousand copies of this album were sold and eventually Ariana Grande went
                   on to become a huge star. She released a few more albums later and all of them managed to garner both commercial and critical acclaim.</p>
